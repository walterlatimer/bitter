# Bitter

Bitter is a slightly saltier version of Twitter.

This app was built as an interactive coding session during Codecademy Labs. The goal of this exercise was to show students how to roll their own authentication in Rails.

## Getting Started

After forking and cloning this repository to your local environment, move into the project directory and start up the server.

```sh
$ cd bitter
$ rails s
```

The app should be available at `localhost:8000`.
